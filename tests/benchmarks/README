This directory contains all the scripts and other necessary files to generate 
benchmark results. 

The directory structure is as follows:
- figures: contains all the figures generated from the metric files
- metrics: contains all the files containing the metric results for a 
  particular benchmark
- outputs: contains all the output files for the benchmark trials (which are 
  used to compute the metrics for each benchmark experiment)
- scripts: contains scripts (python and bash) for handling the benchmark and 
  any auxillary files (e.g files containing accession headers for reference 
  sequences: *_acn.txt)
- seqs: contains all the query sequences that used in the benchmark

The benchmark consists of a number of experiments. Each experiment consists of 
a query fasta file that contains a number of query sequences extracted from a 
reference (and possibly mutated with random substitutions).

The workflow is as follows:

1. Generate query sequences for the benchmark from some reference
2. Run a specific benchmark using those query sequences
3. Compute the metric from the benchmark output files (BIGSI and MashMap)
4. Generate figure from the metric

The master script is `generate_benchmarks.sh` which sources the other necessary 
scripts to run the benchmarks and compute the metrics from their outputs.

The `hg38.office.config.json` is the main configuration file which contains the 
paths to all the required files for running the benchmarks.

To make the query sequences use the `make_dataset_seqs.sh` script.

Note that these scripts will try to take advantage of multiple cores. It is 
best to run them by SSH'ing to the office computer.
